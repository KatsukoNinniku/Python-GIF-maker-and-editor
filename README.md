# Python GIF maker and editor
 A python script with a GUI that allows you to create and edit GIF files.

# Currently this Python script is work in progres
 The module for editing GIFs is not ready yet
 
# KNOWN ISSUES
1. A custom set of loops does not work
2. Image Sequence GIFs do not work properly, please use only the Video GIF creation for now
3. The script has not been tested on Windows yet, only on linux, therefore issues on Windows might arise

# HOw TO SETUP
1. Download all of the PIP dependencies listed in requirements.txt until an .exe file is available
2. Upon launching the script, it will create a config file in the same directory
3. Navigate into settings, then input all of the file paths (GIFSicle is not implemented yet so any path can be put there)
4. Now you are able to go into GIF creation and create GIFs, however as listed above, GIFs from image sequences might come out broken until I find a fix
